For instructions on how to compile and run the application, see README.md.

Here is the list of supported arguments:

contest.........counts to [repeat] with stateful and then stateless beans and measures elapsed time
creation........invokes creation of [repeat] number of stateful and then stateless beans and measures elapsed time
contest-s.......simultaneously counts to [repeat] with stateful and stateless beans and measures elapsed time
creation-s......simultaneously invokes creation of [repeat] number of stateful and stateless beans and measures elapsed time
stateless.......counts to [repeat] with stateless beans and measures elapsed time, the client performs the counting in this case
stateful........counts to [repeat] with stateful bean and measures elapsed time, the server performs the counting in this case
stateless-c.....invokes creation of [repeat] number of stateless beans and measures elapsed time
stateful-c......invokes creation of [repeat] number of stateful beans and measures elapsed time
repeat=x........defines how many times will an invocation be performed, should be a positive number
sleep=x.........sets the delay between invocations, in milliseconds
threads=x.......sets the number of threads that will generate load, this is effectively doubled for simultaneous contests
verbose.........switches the program into verbose mode - good for debugging

Note that exactly one type of action to perform has to be specified, or else the application will proceed to print the help page and exit. These are: "contest", "contest-s", "creation", "creation-s", "stateless", "stateless-c", "stateful" and "stateful-c".
